This can lead to a decrease in system performance, causing slowdowns and lag in applications. Moreover, fragmentation can also lead to disk space being wasted, as fragments may occupy more space than required. This can result in a shortage of disk space, causing the system to become unstable and vulnerable to crashes or errors. In severe cases, fragmentation can also cause the system to run out of disk space, leading to data loss.To maintain optimal performance, it is essential to regularly defragment the disk. Defragmentation reorganizes the fragments of a file and allocates contiguous disk space to store the file.
